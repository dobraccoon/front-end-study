            It seems like everyone is online these days. The Internet not only facilitates interpersonal communication
            between users
            <span>(e.g., email, social media);</span> it’s also a much relied-upon source for all kinds of information.
            And a
            convenient means of
            paying bills and making purchases.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-block">
            Every single online application has that part with which users interact. When you log onto a website, you
            are greeted by
            the welcome page, the menu, site map, and other items that facilitate navigation and utility. All of those
            items fall
            under the collective term of “front end.” The front end includes the user interface, which is the part of
            the website or
            app designed for the consumer’s use.

            Without further ado, before getting started with how to become a front-end developer let us first undersatnd
            what is a

        <h2 class="h-block" id="select1">What Is a Front End Developer?</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-block">
            A front end developer, also known as a front end web developer, is a professional responsible for the design
            and
            implementation of the interface. The users require this interface so that they can access the application in
            question. A
            web designer is a professional who creates a website’s appearance and design. And the front end developer
            makes sure
            that the design works online by using coding <a

                href="https://www.simplilearn.com/best-programming-languages-start-learning-today-article">languages</a>
            such as <a class="simple-link"
                       href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/css-tutorial">CSS</a>, <a
                class="simple-link "
                href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/html-tutorial/what-is-html">HTML</a>, and <a
                class="simple-link"
                href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/javascript-tutorial">JavaScript</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-block">
            We should pause for a moment to clarify the differences between a front end developer, <a
                class="simple-link" href="https://www.simplilearn.com/how-to-become-a-backend-developer-article">back
            end
            developer</a>, and <a
                class="simple-link"
                href="https://www.simplilearn.com/skills-required-to-become-a-full-stack-developer-article">full stack
            developer</a>. Let’s put this in simple terms: a front end developer is
            responsible for the parts of an
            app or website
            that users see and interact with. A back end developer takes care of the “behind the scenes” matters such as
            infrastructure and databases. The full-stack developer is a mixture of both, a jack of all trades that can
            handle the
            whole design process from the beginning to the end.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-block">
            Note that there’s a trend these days where the line between the front end and back end development has been
            blurring.
            Primarily since many of the tasks that fall in the domain of back end developers are being increasingly
            handled by the
            front end developers.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-block">
            As a final aside, there are also full-stack engineers. They are full-stack developers who have project
            management
            experience, adept at disciplines in the configuring, managing, and maintaining computer networks and
            systems.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h-block" id="select2">Front End Developer Roles and Responsibilities</h2>
        <p class="paragraph-block">
            If you're wondering what a front end developer does, he must:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li-block">Decide web page design and structure</li>
            <li class="li-block">Develop features to enhance the users’ experience</li>
            <li class="li-block">Striking a balance between functional and aesthetic design.</li>

                        out there that can help
                        further your education in the coding languages. For extra credit, familiarize yourself with

                        concepts like displaying files and file system navigation. On a related note, you should
                        familiarize yourself with the
                        properties of the Shell, which is the means of accessing operating system functions via a text

                        problem, things are never quite the same again. That’s why a good front end developer learns
                        version control. There is
                        an impressive selection of version control systems to choose from, but if you want to go with

                        You could do this by physically attending classes (which can be a drain on your free time), or
                        taking an online course.
                        There are many appropriate courses out there, but later on, we’ll show you an excellent and

                        less,
                        but you need fewer
                        qualifications. Besides, you’ll be learning from more experienced people, and that’s always
