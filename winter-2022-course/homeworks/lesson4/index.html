            Although the exact number is not known, estimates tell us that there are more than half a million fonts in
            the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although most of these fonts are based on a few of the most popular fonts, and then these are just
            variations, there is
            still a very large number of fonts that look great and can be used in a variety of ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is all great but this font diversity leaves us with a huge dilemma: which fonts do we choose and use
            for our web
            design? Do we go for decorative fonts or modern ones? Or do we choose the bold variant over the light one?
        </p>
        <p>
            The choices are pretty much infinite and because of this, it is easy to choose the wrong type of font and
            get a really
            bad design.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is why it is necessary to know as many different types of fonts as possible and which to use for the
            best possible
            results.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will tell you more about the four main types of fonts, different styles, typeface classification, and
            many other
            things that will be very useful to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this article you will read about:
        </p>
        <ol class="ul-block">
            <li><a href="#select1">Different styles of fonts</a></li>
            <li><a href="#select2">Four main types of fonts</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            So let’s get started!
        </p>
        <h2 class="h-block" id="select1">Different styles of fonts</h2>
        <p>
            Before we start talking about different types, you should know that there is something called the anatomy of
            fonts.
        </p>
        <p>All fonts have something called a baseline and the fonts “sit” on it. There is also something called a mean
            line. All
            fonts “exist” between those two lines, and what is below or above is called ascender and descender.</p>
        <p>Ascender is when part of the lowercase letter goes above the mean line, while descender is when part of the
            lowercase
            letter is positioned below the baseline.</p>
        <p>These elements are something that every font has in common. What sets the fonts apart are the shape,
            thickness, height,
            and much more, which actually classifies the fonts into different groups.</p>
        <p>Overall we can say that the most basic distinction between fonts is the difference between serif and sans
            serif fonts.</p>
        <img alt="serif-sans-serif-image" src="img/serif-sans-serif.jpg">
        <p>Sans serif looks very simple, while serif font looks decorative. Certain parts on the serif font that look
            like
            ornamentals and are called “serifs” do not exist on sans serif, which actually means “without serifs”. That
            is the key
            difference between them.</p>
        <p>There are many subcategories within serif and sans serif fonts as well as a few more types we will talk
            about in the
            next paragraph.</p>
        <h2 class="h-block" id="select2">What are four main types of fonts?</h2>
        <p>There are four main types of fonts that you will encounter often and most fonts are just variations of one
            of these four
            types.</p>
        <p>By some classifications, there are five main types of fonts, and that depends on whether weak serif fonts
            count as a
            separate type or just a subcategory of serif fonts.</p>
        <p>We agree with a classification that states that there are 4 main types of fonts, and these are, in addition
            to the
            already mentioned serif and sans serif fonts, script fonts, and display fonts.</p>
        <p>Let’s learn more about them and mention some of the most famous variations on these 4 main types.</p>
        <ul class="ul-block">
            <li class="li-block">Serif fonts</li>
            <li class="li-block">Sans serif fonts</li>
            <li class="li-block">Script fonts</li>
            <li class="li-block">Display fonts</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="h-block">Serif fonts</h3>
        <p>The reason for this font being first on our list is because it is the oldest font type.</p>
        <p>It originated from Roman carvings, and there are two theories why the Romans had serifs on their letters.
        </p>
        <p>The first one states that, during the process of carving the letters into stone, the stone carvers
            unavoidably created
            the serifs while following the outlines of the letters.</p>
        <p>The second theory suggests that the use of serifs was deliberate and that they were used to neaten the ends
            of lines.</p>
        <p>Whichever the case, letters with serifs became the default and were used for centuries, so when Gutenberg
            devised the
            movable type printing press, the books were printed in letters with serifs.</p>
        <p>Because of their origin, serif fonts are associated with the old and traditional, but this doesn’t mean
            they’re not used
            anymore.</p>
        <p>There are 4 types of serif fonts that have their own separate uses and variants, so let’s take a look:</p>
        <ul class="ul-block">
            <li class="li-block">Old-style serif fonts</li>
            <li class="li-block">Transitional serif fonts</li>
            <li class="li-block">Didone serif fonts</li>
            <li class="li-block">Slab serif fonts</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="garamond-font">
            <h3 class="h-block">Old-style serif fonts</h3>
            <p>This serif font style originated in 1465, shortly after Gutenberg invented the movable type
                printing press.
            </p>
            <p>Old-style serif fonts were inspired by the Renaissance and had great readability on the rough paper that
                they were
                printed on back then.</p>
            <p>Let’s look at an old-style serif font:</p>
            <img alt="garamond-image" src="img/garamond.jpg">
            <p>These fonts are characterized by a small difference between thick and thin lines, as well as curves that
                connect the
                serifs to the strokes.</p>
            <p>Other old-time serif fonts include Bembo, Bookerly, Cartier, Callisto, Gentium, Palatino, Requiem, and
                many
                others.</p>
            <p>Nowadays, they’re rarely used in web design, but they have found their use in printing, book covers, and
                movie posters.
                Penguin Books, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, the National Gallery, and many
                others
                use Bembo as
                their body typeface.</p>
            <p>Fun fact: The Requiem font is most often used for credits in movies and TV shows.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="times-new-roman-font">
            <h3 class="h-block">Transitional serif fonts</h3>
            <p>These fonts are also referred to as baroque fonts and became widely used mid-18th century. They got their
                name because
                they present a mix of old-time and more modern fonts. Times New Roman is a type of transitional
                font:</p>
            <img alt="times-new-roman-image" src="img/times-new-roman.jpg">
            <p>The difference between thick and thin lines is more obvious, and many of them have more round serifs (as
                opposed to
                strokes) and a more vertical axis.</p>
            <p>Other transitional fonts include Baskerville, Georgia, Bookman, Cambria, Perpetua, and others. They’re
                still
                very much
                used, here’s a website of a developer and designer that uses the Times New Roman font:</p>
        </div>
        <img alt="my-name-is-image" src="img/my-name-is.jpg">
        <div class="libre-bodoni">
            <h3 class="h-block">Didone serif fonts</h3>
            <p>Didone is a more modern version of the serif fonts and it first appeared in the late 18th century. These
                fonts were
                immediately a huge hit and could be found everywhere.</p>
            <p>The designers of the first Didone fonts, the printers Firmin Didot, Giambattista Bodoni, and Justus Erich
                Walbaum,
                wanted more elegant fonts that would show the more refined printing techniques. Here’s an example of a
                Didone font:</p>
            <img alt="libre-bodoni-image" src="img/libre-bodoni.jpg">
            <p>It looks pretty modern, doesn’t it? And how sharp do those serifs look? Compared to the previous two
                serif
                types, this
                one is sleeker and looks neater and more trimmed.</p>
            <p>Didone fonts are characterized by narrow serifs that have a constant width, thick vertical strokes of
                letters, and a
                strong contrast between the horizontal and vertical parts of letters.</p>
            <p>Out of the four serif types, the Didone fonts are used the most in web design.</p>
            <img alt="fashion-image" src="img/fashion.jpg">
            <p>The Didone fonts are usually associated with fashion, but they can be found everywhere. Here’s a mattress
                company’s
                website that uses a unique Didone font:</p>
        </div>
        <img alt="allswell-image" src="img/allswell.jpg">
        <div class="rockwell-font">
            <h3 class="h-block">Slab serif fonts</h3>
            <p>The slab serif fonts appeared during the early 19th century. Their purpose was to grab attention, hence
                their main
                characteristic: thick and bold serifs. Here’s Rockwell, a slab serif with a geometric design and
                consistent
                line
                thickness:</p>
            <img alt="rockwell-image" src="img/rockwell.jpg">
            <p>In the past few years, their use significantly increased, probably because of their bold and clean
                design.
                They used to
                be everywhere: from magazine and book covers, brand logos, and web design. Their use is not that common
                lately.</p>
            <p>There’s a website that uses the Soho slab serif font for both the title and the body text:</p>
